A small game I developed using simple HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This game is a simple jumping game with few lines. This is my first HTML game, so am sorry if my coding are not as good. Hope you guys can try it and suggest any improvement I can do!

This game consists of three files which are:
1. index.html - Stores the layout for this game.
2. style.css - Stores the stylings for the whole game.
3. script.js - Store the logic of the game.

All the assets inside does not belong to me, credits to the owner of the respective assets.
NOTE: The current version only supports for Desktop view only.
